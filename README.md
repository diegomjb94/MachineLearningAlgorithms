# Machine Learning Algorithms
Basic examples of machine learning algorithms.

This repository was created with the objective of illustrating basic machine learning algorithms to students of the Technological University of Panama.

The repository contains a series of Python notebooks in which each one of the algorithms is shown step by step. The algorithms present in this repository are

- Linear regression.
- Decision trees.
- Neural networks.
- K-means.
